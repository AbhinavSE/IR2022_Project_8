Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away
If you can use some exotic booze, there's a bar in far Bombay
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away

Come fly with me, let's float down to Peru
In llama land, there's a one man band, and he'll toot his flute for you
Come fly with me, let's take off in the blue

Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together
Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
Just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly away


Once I get you up there, where the air is rarefied
We'll just glide, starry-eyed
Once I get you up there, I'll be holding you so near
You may hear angels cheer 'cause we're together

Weather wise, it's such a lovely day
You just say the words and we'll beat the birds down to Acapulco Bay
It's perfect for a flying honeymoon, they say
Come fly with me, let's fly, let's fly

Pack up, let's fly away7Embed",
Ed Sheeran,÷,Eraser,,Freak37,/songs/01 - Eraser.mp3,/image/cover-1.jpg,"Eraser Lyrics
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more

Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser

And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

In the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go

I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah

And I'm dying for the rush

How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?

I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising

I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious

What if this storm ends?
And I don't see you
As you are now
Ever again
The perfect halo
Of gold hair and lightning
Sets you off against
The planet's last dance
Just for a minute
The silver forked sky
Lit you up like a star
That I will follow
Now it's found us
Like I have found you
I don't want to run
Just overwhelm me
What if this storm ends?
And leaves us nothing
Except a memory
A distant echo
I want pinned down
I want unsettled
Rattle cage after cage
Until my blood boils
I want to see you
As you are now
Every single day
That I am living
Painted in flames
All peeling thunder
Be the lightning in me
That strikes relentless
(II) The Sunlight Through The Flags
From here the caravans are kids toys
And I can hold them all in my palm
I watch the sea creep round the corner
It connects the dots from here to you
The sunlight burning through the loose flags
Painted high on white church walls
I chase my blood from brain to thumped heart
Until I'm out of breath for trying
Worry not everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars
These accidents of faith and nature
They tend to stick in the spokes of you
But every now and then the trend bucks
And you're repaired by more than glue
Worry not everything is sound
This is the safest place you've found
The only noise beating out is ours
Lacing our tea from honey jars
Why don't you rest your fragile bones
A minute ago you looked alone
Stop waving your arms you're safe and dry
Breathe in and drink up the winter sky
(III) Daybreak
Slowly the day breaks apart in our hands
And soft hallelujahs flow in from the church
The one on the corner you said frightened you
It was too dark and too large to find your soul in
Something was bound to go right sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together to make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like
Salad bowls and basins and buckets for bailing out the flood
As motionless cars rust on driveways and curbs
You take off your raincoat and stretch out your arms
We both laugh out loud and surrender to it
The sheer force of sky and the cold magnet Earth
Something was bound to go right sometime today
All these broken pieces fit together to make a perfect picture of us
It got cold and then dark so suddenly and rained
It rained so hard the two of us were the only thing
That we could see for miles and miles
And in the middle of the flood I felt my worth
When you held onto me like I was your little life raft
Please know that you were mine as well
Drops of water hit the ground like God's own tears
And spread out into shapes like
Salad bowls and basins and buckets for bailing out the floodEmbed",

Don't wanna let you know

But I can feel it take a hold (I can feel it take a hold)
I can feel you take control (I can feel you take control)
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote

Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet

I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out

'Cause now I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it

Feelin' low on serotonin and better days

When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides

I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way

Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars

Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me

Me and all my friends
We're all misunderstood
They say we stand for nothing and
There's no way we ever could
Now we see everything that's going wrong
With the world and those who lead it
We just feel like we don't have the means
To rise above and beat it

So we keep waiting (Waiting)

We keep on waiting (Waiting)

So we keep waiting (Waiting)

To bring our neighbors home from war
They would have never missed a Christmas
No more ribbons on their door
And when you trust your television
What you get is what you got
Cause when they own the information, oh
They can bend it all they want

That's why we're waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
We keep on waiting (Waiting)
Waiting on the world to change
It's not that we don't care
We just know that the fight ain't fair
So we keep on waiting (Waiting)

Is gonna rule the population

I will never bother you
I will never promise to
I will never follow you
I will never bother you
Never speak a word again
I will crawl away for good
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
And always knew it would come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Hey, hey, hey
You know you're right
You know you're right, you know you're right
I'm so warm and calm inside
I no longer have to hide
Let's talk about someone else
Steaming soup against her mouth
Nothing really bothers her
She just wants to love himself
I will move away from here
You won't be afraid of fear
No thought was put into this
Always knew it'd come to this
Things have never been so swell
I have never failed to fail

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey

Ed Sheeran,÷,Castle on the Hill,,Freak37,/songs/02 - Castle on the Hill.mp3,/image/cover-16.jpg,"Castle on the Hill Lyrics
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer""
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill89Embed",

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""

One minute I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Oh, who would ever want to be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)

Be my mirror, my sword and shield

My missionaries in a foreign field
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-woah)
For some reason, I can't explain

How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes, they're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how, as well
Just know that these things will never change for us at all

We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while
Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland

I know you're mine all mine, all mine

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes
When you smile, you've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth

And I'm in love with you and all these little things

There is magic abroad in the air
I'm often told that the streets turn into gold
When the moon shines on Circus and Square
Deep in the dark that envelops the park
There's romance in each cigarette's glow
Down by the Thames, lights that sparkle like gems
Seem to wink at each girl and her beau
Up comes the moon when the city's asleep
He's not alone, for it seems
Somewhere up there stands an angel to keep
Her watch while each Londoner dreams
My love and I saw the sun leave the sky
Then we kissed in the fast-fading light

But lovers love London by nightEmbed",

A veces, no confío en lo que siento
En mi Instagram diciendo ""еstoy curada""
Me preocupa si todavía tengo atractivo sеxual
Esperando que no salirme de esta colina
Cuando hagamos el amor, quiero estar ahí
Y quiero sentirte tirando de mi pelo
Y creer en las palabras que me dices al oído
Tengo que salir, necesito un poco de aire

Quiero, quiero, quiero tocarte
Quiero tocarte, pero mis dedos están entumecidos

The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times

I'm older than I wish to be
This town holds no more for me
All my life I try to find another way
I don't care for your attitude
You bring me down I think you're rude

Waiting for my memories

Rocking in your rocking chair
It's all too much for me to take

Ayy, ayy

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

Show up at my door, but I don't live there anymore
Sendin' me our songs, but they don't really sound like before
I was crazy for you, all caught up and confused (Ah)
Love was broken for me, now it's broken for you
You're only lonely
Now that you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it

Isn't it somethin' that I get more when I'm givin' you nothin'? (Huh)
Isn't it magic that when you stop lookin' for it, it happens? (Oh)
Baby, he fell from grace, landed right in your place
Kissed me so many times that I forgot your taste

You're only lonely
Now that you ain't the one to hold me
Only lonely now, now

So you want me now? That's funny (Hey)
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)
If you wanted me so desperately, you shoulda said it
You shoulda said it, love
Shoulda said it
Shoulda said it, love

I wish that you could turn back the time
You'd hold me closer instead of your pride (Ooh, oh)
I knew it was you from the very first night
And it took you two years to make up your mind

So you want me now? That's funny
'Cause you didn't give a... back then
Comin' back around, so sorry (Ayy)
'Cause there's no room in my bed
And I'm all good now, someone else is gettin' all of me (Ah)

To seek a kiss not mine alone

Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you

Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

It was a long and dark December
From the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember
From the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured
By a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me, won't you let me know?

Was a long and dark December
When the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto bibles
Hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor
When I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze
And if you love me, won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship
Would stow, far below

So if you love me, why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?22Embed",

I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from ""A"" to where you'd ""B""
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me
And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have travelled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weepin'
A joy you can't keep in

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground and I
I pray that somethin' picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control

Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do

Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but

But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light
Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe

'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you

Lambchop with the doors off
Lil' bitch, you know I got a wife
As she proceed to take her clothes off
Self-driven, this the life I chose
My tunnel vision was somethin' like El Chopo's
Black Swan on my toes, watch for the potholes
I rather focus on how much water the pot holds
Started out breakin' records, now we breakin' records
Never thought I would be famous for my indiscretions
She up and down on my pole, but this ain't no elеction
I'm busy fuckin' the globe, bitch, I don't need protection
Corrеction; this my C-section, how ya livin'?
They makin' music but we on a different algorithm
Lookin' at life through a glass jar, cloudy vision
All I ever needed was one mic, Scottie Pippen
I thought I told niggas this come with the territory
New gold digger, that come with the territory
The lifestyles of the rich get dangerous
Some die with a name, others die nameless
I heard they plottin' on me, that come with the territory
Keep that thang on me, yeah, that's self-explanatory
But I ain't scared, speakin' the truth will get you canceled fast
That's Dre drop, this type of talk come with a sandwich bag

I'm in this bitch with a double cup
She wanna smoke, lemme show you the ropes, double dutch
Time to level up, nigga, paper been long
Gators hangin' out the Lamb', Fred Flinstone
B-baller, s-shot caller
Twenty-inch blades and they on the impala
So many years in the game, I done became a Rottweiler
Survivor, with motherfuckin' diamonds on my collar
Made nigga, fuck yo' advice, really got a billi' in my sights
Blowin Za', reachin; new heights
Buckle up, we 'bout to take flight
Cartier froze, just watch
VV's drippin' on Watts
FedEx, I'm beatin' up the box
Bad bitches, drop it like it's hot

Five feet seven of bones and skin
But when she tells me maybe she loves me
I feel as mellow as a fellow can be
She's so skinny, she's so drawn
When she stands sideways, you'd think she's gone
But when she calls me baby, I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
She's slender, but she's tender
She makes my heart surrender
And every night, when I hold her tight
The feeling is nice, my arms can go around twice
My lean baby, she's so slim
A broomstick's wider, but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me, then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go
My lean baby, strange to see
And all that nothing, it belongs to me
And though she may be scrawny, she's okay
Because I wouldn't want her any other way
Man, she's so skinny, she's so drawn
When she stands sideways, you would think that she's gone
But when she calls me baby, I feel fine
To think she's frantically, romantically mine
I chased her - and I caught her
Then a diamond ring, I bought her
Hey, the diamonds shine, the ring is so fine
But here is the twist, she wears it right on her wrist
My lean baby, she's so slim
A broomstick's wider, but not as trim
And when she starts to kiss me, then I know
I love her so, I'll never, ever, let her go

With our rain-washed histories

And as the kids took back the parks

We want the finer things, the shit that's еxpensive
The shit that hit 'еm either close range or at a distance
If God for me, nigga, why bother?
I got my game from the Godfather (Woof)
Top of the food chain, rock bottom
And handled my business when it was my problem
G shit, nigga flossin' with a gold chain
I got my Turkish rope with matchin' gold fangs
Bomber jacker in the winter, it's a cold game
I met some East Coast niggas up in Spokane (What up?)
Some of the realest niggas in this dope game
I got my curly top, lookin' like Special Ed
Clean fade on the side, bumpin' that redhead
Clean tags when I ride, duckin' the fed-feds
East Coast niggas, they get that bread-bread
You fuck with them niggas, you end up dead-dead
Them West Coast niggas, they leave that lead spread
And now you got bullets all in your dread head
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me
They the ones stirrin' up the conflict
Then try to make it out like I'm conflicted
Bitches
Still tryna fuck the riches
East Coast niggas in six-fours hittin' switches (Shit)
It's not a conflict of interest
Cuh, them niggas with the business
West Coast niggas rockin' them Timberlands deep up in them trenches
It's no difference

Fourth and inches
I'm finna hit a lick and handle business
I got a down bitch, she real vicious
Rock-a-bye baby, no witness
This is not even a conflict
You niggas on nonsense
Niggas die the same way in Brooklyn and Compton
But niggas with that gang-gang, them niggas make a profit
Niggas on top, niggas stay poppin'
Look, see, I was the high school Slick Rick, I was stylin'
Fat gold chain with an African medallion
Hip-hop connoisseur and Rollin' 20 Crippin'
Rap game real tight, freestyle was magnificent
All about the clout and all about my dividends
Them older niggas couldn't tell me different
I need a 'round the way girl to let me stick it in
Showtime at the Apollo
I'm drinking OE up out the bottle
Take two swigs and pour out a little liquor for my niggas who won't live to see tomorrow
If God for me, who could be against me?
I guess all them niggas that's against me

""Welcome to the real world"", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat, take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding up my sleeve

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side
I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above

So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats, grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books, but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents, they're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories, tiny tragedies

They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive

I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above
I just can't wait 'til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was for16Embed",

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on, to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration, hip-hip-hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
It's so still, the fire's barely fighting the cold alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were, you were the first full stop
Love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it or leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass

Took a car downtown and took what they offered me
To set me free

Saw the lights go down and standing in front of me

When they smash my heart into smithereens
Be a bright red rose come bursting through concrete
Be a cartoon heart
Light a fire, a fire, a spark
Light a fire, a flame in my heart

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl

You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, ""Baby, I just want to dance""

I'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say

What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'

And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again

What if you're someone I just want around?

Lightning strike
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain

Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare

If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
If you want more love
Why don't you say so?
Just say so

How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all
It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God we're gonna get it right
If you lay your weapon down

Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak

It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare

Here's another Sunday morning call
Yer hear yer head-a-banging on the door
Slip your shoes on and then out you crawl
Into a day that couldn't give you more
But what for?

And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel?
And you take what you want
But you don't get it for free
You need more time
'Cause your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure if it'll ever work out right
But it's ok
It's all right
When you're lonely and you start to hear
The little voices in your head at night
You will only sniff away the tears
So you can dance until the morning light
At what price?

And in your head do you feel
What you're not supposed to feel?
And you take what you want
But you won't get it for free
You need more time
Because your thoughts and words won't last forever more
And I'm not sure if it'll ever work out right

But you won't get hope for free

And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, I'll never know
What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

Woah, woah
Gravity, stay the hell away from me
Woah, woah
Gravity has taken better men than me
Now, how can that be?

Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is

Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away?
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe

It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Oh, I could never tell you, ""LY""
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face

It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again

Oh, I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side

And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch

Don't call me ""baby"" again, it's hard for me to go home

I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry

Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time

But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real

I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow

Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says ""Chune, bwoydem light up the room!""
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man

Just for a tender while, I kissed the smile apon her face

Never dreaming that we were parting
And I lied as a whispered ""mañana""

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony

That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane

That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me

Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up

And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano

That's why I go for that rock and roll music

It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music

All this feels strange and untrue
And I won't waste a minute without you
My bones ache, my skin feels cold
And I'm getting so tired and so old
The anger swells in my guts
And I won't feel these slices and cuts
I want so much to open your eyes
'Cause I need you to look into mine

Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Tell me that you'll open your eyes
Get up, get out, get away from these liars
'Cause they don't get your soul or your fire
Take my hand, knot your fingers through mine
And we'll walk from this dark room for the last time
Every minute from this minute now
We can do what we like anywhere
I want so much to open your eyes

I’m here when you see the weed smoke in the air
Party people, wave your hands like you just don't care
Crip your enthusiasm

Mm, pen and paper, money maker, let the beat ride
Let me put you up on this nigga from the east side
This nigga born ready, serve a nigga ether
With the pen or off the heady, this nigga flow is dеadly (Where he at?)
Right hеre, Snoop Dogg, I'm with the G Child
Play something, let me fuck you up just with this freestyle (That’s dope)
For sure, but let's make a real record with real effort
'Cause my pen game is lethal cyanide mixed with ether
Spittin' nothin' but them hits out
The Chronic put the world up on this shit Snoopy been about
I wrote it down, needed backup, called the hounds
I'm worldwide, you know the voice, you know the sound (Ha-ha)
Paint it like Picasso, my spot on top of the charts
You ain't fuckin' with the Dogg, I do this shit every day
I don’t play with this here, just look at my resume
I’m probably Pimp of the Year, that's what all the players say
My smooth tone, reppin’ for the blue zone
Crip shit, for niggas to get they groove on (Hey)
I tell my street life glory in a east side story
I got that Hall of Fame pen game, nigga, ain't shit changed
Still leave you niggas assed out like Ving Rhames
Ever since I started, I've been all about big things
Crip it, curve it, flip it and serve it
I'm at your service so don’t get nervous
These are words coming from the Dogg
And everything I do is lit (Yes, sir)
Hoppin' right along, tryna get my party on
Call my nigga (Leon Black), let's go bust a bitch (Mm)

La-di-da-di, Snoopy's in the party
Smokin' that yessir, the best served, that's good for everybody
It's some players in the house, if you see 'em, point 'em out
Pulled up in that Bentley with my nigga Leon Black with me
That's simply two layers of mackin' on you bitches
Like true players (But I'm here with my baby daddy), bitch, who cares?
We came to make the party crack, no games
I'm in the party strapped, Snoop Dogg and Black, now, where the party at?
Pop that champagne bottle, we goin' up full throttle
Don't matter, wherever Snoopy go, these hoes gon' follow
Glasses up, we toastin', Backwoods I'm smokin'
V.I.P., I'm posted, eeny-meeny-miney
You know where to find me
With a cute-faced bitch, big ass and waist tiny
I got 'em lined up like tic-tac-toe, that's three in a row
An exotic bitch, a snow bunny and me and your ho
We all up in the club livin' our best life
Black gave a nigga thumbs, nigga like, ""That's right""
Hit the dance floor with some twins, they was close friends
Back that ass up, she said, ""Grab it with both hands""
Now players do what players do

Sitting by the phone, holding onto hope
Spending all night wondering why you let me go (You let me go)
I wish you had felt how you're feeling two years ago
Oh, nah

Hurts me to hurt you, baby
Lying awake and everything has changed
Keeping our distance lately
Kills me to kill you when I tell you
That I felt it once, I can't feel it twice
It's more than I can take, baby
Hurts me to tell you I don't feel the same
I can feel you still staring at me when I look away
Can't imagine the pain that you feel when I kiss his face

That's when you said
""How can I be your friend when I know the way you taste?
It's almost 2 AM and I can't ask you to stay""
I don't know what's worse, getting broken or making it break
Oh, ah

Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
""Oh, we're in love, aren't we?""
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby

Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah

She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my

But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear

That will safely guide me home

Or the thought of growing old

Shut your eyes, I'll spin the big chair
And you'll feel dizzy, light and free
And falling gently on the cushion
You can come and sing to me
And when the worrying starts to hurt
And the world feels like graves of dirt
Just close your eyes until

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low, then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all

Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us

What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat

'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's got to change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time

Just sitting here reminiscing, man
Pushing on
Gotta keep pushing on
Mm
You gotta keep push—

Who remember growing up eating Corn Flakes?
Spend the night at granny house 'cause momma on a date
So you ate what you ate and you ate it quick
'Cause you knew your grandma, she ain't play that shit
Paw Paw, he stayed in another house
With another woman, she a brick house
Growing up fast was a shit show
It's a fеw things I learned from the gеt go
A few folks in my fam fell down
Then they got they feet back on solid ground
And came back around and showed me how to fail
See there's a lesson every time a nigga take a L
Dead or in jail, that's the fairytale
What I know about it? I know it very well
That's why I don't stop, won't stop, can't quit
Keep pushing making that dope shit
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad
Whether happy or sad
Tryna stand as a man
You gotta keep pushing on
We will see what they do
Keep your head up and move
Love will always come through (Yeah, a'ight Snoop)
You gotta keep push—

Through hell or high water, keep my confidence on the level
Let my family support me, it could be me against whoever
Say I'm cancelled, I say even better
Man, who gon' tell 'em?
Your opinion doesn't validate me, I been the shit
In my hood, can't get no better, could never intimidate me
Trap music say we geniuses, politics say we crazy (Shit)
Man, I was selling Ye when Brenda had a baby
When nothing but hip-hop could come and save me
And I just sat there on the pavement
Tryna find a way to make some payment
Had first dibs when they came in
Selling pounds of reefer was strange then (What?)
For eight thousand they gave me ten of 'em
Drove to make it make twenty off the same ten
All our lives we were taught to just hold the pain in (For real)
Imitate Neanderthals and copy cavemen
Can't teach a man how to make it with a handout
Fuck fitting in, keep pushing until you standout
You gotta keep push—
Through the good and the bad

Talking to the songbird yesterday
Flew me to a place not far away
She's a little pilot in my mind
Singing songs of love to pass the time
Going to write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me
Talk of better days that have yet to come
Never felt this love from anyone

She's not anyone
She's not anyone
She's not anyone

A man can never dream these kinds of things
Especially when she came and spread her wings
Whispered in my ear the things I'd like
Then she flew away into the night
Going to write a song so she can see
Give her all the love she gives to me

Said I'd never leave her 'cause her hands fit like my t-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again?

If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again
Can we take the same road
Two days in the same clothes
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute?
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
Tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart
We can both remove the masks and admit we regret it from the start

If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone?
If you're pretending from the start like this
With a tight grip, then my kiss
Can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
(All my heart)
So we can start it all over again
If you're pretending from the start like this with a tight grip
(If you're pretending from the start, yeah)
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I can lend you broken parts that might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, ""Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels""

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

And I'ma show you how to get this dough

And we gon' get our bread up
While I roll my weed up
In my Sandbox with my feet up (Feet up)
We keep blowin' trees, all these emergencies
A hundred-million-dollar deals with this cryptocurrency
Spitter, hitter, did her, get her, man, I got a lotta moves
Used to spend a lotta bread on a whole lotta jewels
Fools learn fast, so I must be the fastest
Took all my classes, learned it by the masses
Surpassed all the masters, now I'm the master
Last thing out there is my Doggystyle masters
Yeah, I gotta have it like a bad habit
'Cause Doggystyle, nigga, was a motherfuckin' classic (Ooh-wee)
Am I lyin'? No, you not
It was hot, so motherfucker, gimme what you got
Now we can get off into some gangsta shit
We can laugh, toast or blast (What up, cuz?)
Or you can be a gentleman
And handle this shit like you got some class

Go and tell it to the man who cannot shine
Some might say that we should never ponder
On our thoughts today 'cause they hold sway over time

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
You made no preparation
For my reputation once again
The sink is full of fishes
She's got dirty dishes on the brain
It was overflowing gently
But it's all elementary my friend

Some might say they don't believe in heaven
Go and tell it to the man who lives in hell
Some might say you get what you've been given
If you don't get yours I won't get mine as well

Some might say we will find a brighter day
Some might say we will find a brighter day

'Cause I've been standing at the station
In need of education in the rain
That made no preparation
For my reputation once again

And my dog's been itching
Itching in the kitchen once again

Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown, but for me, they look the same
Sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel
You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Another ""I, me, mine"" to blur the lines between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right and always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy

Don't let them tell you ""Keep it all inside""
I know the winds have got to change

You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seems like time
Can be so much more than a wake-up call, and live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over, read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change
You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play

It must have been a year since
I was thrown across an ocean far from home
Life is making no sense
Riding in between the highs and lows

Woah, when I wake in the morning I, ooh
It's the first on my mind

Maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stone
And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't born of skin and bone
Under the sun, above the waves
Under three crowns when I'm far away
Maybe what I miss most
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
Maybe you'll never know

Life beyond the window
I'm jealous of the way that black bird flies
Free among the people
Those quarter million stories pass me by

Woah, lie awake in the moonlight, I ooh
It's the last on my mind

And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stone
And maybe what I miss most
It wasn't born of skin and bone
Under the sun, above the waves
Under three crowns when I'm far away
Maybe what I miss most

And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
And maybe you'll never know
I remember at the table
All those faces, where did they go?
I imagine what it looks like
When I'm not there
I remember, every summer
But now the years are, just a number
There's no backwards
Time is faster with everything I've left behind, oh

But maybe what I miss most
It wasn't made of steel and stone
And maybe what I miss most

You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true

Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do

Lola
Era a mais inteligente da escola, ela era uma supernova
Ela tinha uma mente além de seu tempo, foi uma emoção conhecê-la
Ela tinha sonhos que ela se apaixonaria, algum lugar como Barcelona

Ela poderia ter andado na lua, sim
Ela poderia nos encontrar uma cura
Mas a família não tinha comida e
Ela teve que deixar a escola para trabalhar
Ninguém quebra o teto
Ninguém de onde ela é
Ninguém quebra o teto, sim
Ninguém está ouvindo, então ela não vai falar, não vai falar
Todos esses sonhos estão desaparecendo lentamente, lentamente
Ela conhece as histórias sobre a polícia, polícia
É do jeito que é, então não fale, não fale

Ela acreditou no mundo que eles prometeram a ela, mas agora ela está mais velha
Ela viu as pessoas discordarem e desaparecerem
A energia acabou por dias, nenhuma comida está a caminho
Nada muda, este não é o sonho que eles nos venderam

Ela poderia ter andado na lua, sim
Poderia nos encontrar uma cura
Mas ela se preocupava com seus filhos

Mas alguém mudou o roteiro do seu filme
E para começar de novo, ela só pede
Do mundo baixo ela vem
Quanto você vale, quanto você tem
Esse é o preço da minha Lola quando não há saída
Ela quer liberdade, ela quer pátria e vida

Ninguém está ouvindo, então ela não vai falar, não vai falar
Todos esses sonhos estão desaparecendo lentamente, lentamente
Ela conhece as histórias sobre a polícia, polícia
É do jeito que é, então não fale, não fale

Not our last days of silent screamin' blur
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walkin' out the door

You made me happier than I'd been by far

What's on your mind?
'Cause I've been thinking 'bout last night
What's the time?
Feels like I've sat here all my life

Your ship rolls in, I'm here waiting
I don't know why, I'm paralysed
Oh, what I'd do to be with you
Oh, what I'd give

To hear you say that ""I love you""
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I in this hotel room
And say that ""I miss you""
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to hide tonight
My eyes can't lie, the way I feel for you
Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room
Couldn't work out why you gave me all those signs
So tell me now before I lose my mind

Your ship sails in, I am waiting
You stand close by, and watch me cry
Oh, what I'd do to be with you
Oh, what I'd give

To hear you say that ""I love you""
But say it the way I do
There's nowhere to run tonight
It's just you and I in this hotel room

There's nowhere to hide tonight

Just give me a moment, it's all I ask of you
While I'm dying in this hotel room

Hold out your hand
Give me a light in the dark
You know that I'm broken
Don't leave me here broken
To hear you say that ""I love you""
But hear it the way I do

It's been a while since we've been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment, I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes

Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time
And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion

It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize-ize

'Cause one thing I know, it's this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Living fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh

Love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives

Eighty-six thousand, four hundred seconds in a day
I swear lately most of 'em have been a waste
I feel 'em come and go, bury my mistakes
But time just goes on and on in a way

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do
If I had nothing to lose, nah, nothing to lose
Oh, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry
I never call her back
I'd pour my heart and soul out into a letter
And send it to my dad
Like, oh my God, the time I've wasted
Lost in my head
Let me leave this world with the hate behind me
And take the love instead

Give me
Only love, only love
Give me
Only love, only love

I swear sometimes I hear myself talking, getting mad
Take shit so personal, like it really matters
Oh, am I awake, am I sleepwalking? Tell me that
It's scary how quickly I lose perspective and I react

If I had one day left to live
And if the stars went out on me, the truth is
Yeah, there's so much I'd say and do

How can this true gangster shit be still outside the box?

We came from a place where our hearts are pure
People wanna know what we're marchin' for
Grouped up, scooped up all my pals
Flavor for days, so much style
They can't even put it in a box now (Wow)
Stepped out, gator smile, wait a while
""Excuse me, Snoopy, can we get a flick?""
I ain't really trippin', go on, take that shit
What? It's really gon' be 'bout gettin' love
And that's only 'cause I give love
I stand up for it, I manned up for it like a brother 'posed to
Went through, go through, goin' through, knowin' you
Showin' you, flowin' to and the mental to grow into

Built a massive team that's passion themed
Do it for the love, on top there's the cream

Run it up, rake enough, make enough to give back

I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind

Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?
I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul

Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?

So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down

Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay
Still ""everything happens for a reason""
Is no reason not to ask myself

Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?

And ice cream castles in the air
And feather canyons everywhere

But now they only block the sun
They rain and snow on everyone
So many things I would have done
But clouds got in my way

I've looked at clouds from both sides now

It's cloud's illusions I recall
I really don't know clouds at all
Moons and Junes and ferris wheels
The dizzy dancing way you feel
As every fairy tale comes real
I've looked at love that way
But now it's just another show
You leave 'em laughing when you go
And if you care don't let 'em know
Don't give yourself away

I've looked at love from both sides now
From give and take and still somehow
It's love's illusions I recall
I really don't know love at all

Tears and fears and feeling proud
To say, ""I love you"" right out loud
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds
I've looked at life that way
But now old friends are acting strange
They shake their heads, they say I've changed
But something's lost but something's gained

I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go

Didn't wanna ask our friend if you were gonna be here
And make the whole thing weird
But I was nervous in the car just in case you are
Just in case the coast ain't clear
And I'm looking over people's shoulders
And that's fucked up, I know that

And I just had this vision of you looking at me different
When you saw this dress
But I'd have one drink and I'd say the wrong thing
So it's probably for the best
And I'm looking over peoples' shoulders
And I'm hoping that you're somewhere close
But everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
I don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do

I got in last night, staying on the west side
Scotty told me you're here
And I'm having these thoughts, did we fuck it up or not?
Did we waste two years?
And did you get the space you needed?
Did you realize you don't need me?
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?

Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into

I broke into your house last night
And left a note at your bedside
I'm far too shy to speak to you at school
You leave me numb, and I'm not sure why

I find it easier to sit and stare
Than push my limbs out towards you right there
My heart is bursting in your perfect eyes
As blue as oceans and as pure as skies

I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds in the t-hut
A little peace of mind that I know better
Than the plain disgrace of all my letters
But after that the floodgates opened up
And I fell in love with everyone I saw
Please take your time, I'm not in any rush
And it's in everything I ever write

It's not as if I need the extra weight
Confused enough by life, so thanks a lot
Lonely written words for company
Just raise the roof this once and follow me

I struggle for the words and then give up
My head's up with the birds on the T hut
A little peace of mind that I know better

We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Lived a man who sailed to sea

So we sailed on to the sun

And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine

We all live in a yellow submarine

And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play

We all live in a yellow submarine

Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant

Ayo, Dogg, what's happenin' with motherfuckin' hip-hop, man?
Give us some lyrics, cuh
Some of that real hip-hop, you know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Boy, you lost it, nigga

It was him (Who?) then me (Who?) and no one after
So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
Stomped down pterodactical raptors
Game's sustained, my new jersey's in the rafters

Statisticians, they keep up with it
No sleep 'til they get it
And once they got it, they count it
So I learned how to dismount it
My landing was perfect
A man with a purpose
I learned to resurface
A boss but no workers
While you're sleepin', I'm lurkin'
I'm shifty at fifty, I keep the work and I'm workin'
Big Snoop D-O-double-G
Yеllow like bumblebee
Mellow likе R&B
Your bitches keep followin' me
I'm right where I oughta be
Plottin' my pottery
I'm watchin' my calories
Rechargin' my batteries
A ticket up front? That's my usual salary
They imitatin' my style, shit, I call it flattery
I'm here forever, nigga, and that's just what that'll be
Look it up, hook it up
Charge it to the game until you book it up
Take a picture, nigga, look at us
Hit-Boy and Snoop Dogg in the kitchen, nigga, cookin' up
Ayy, Dogg, get on the phone with Dre, tell Dre call Interscope, tell them niggas run me my shit or else, nigga

The Game's to be sold, Blood, not to be told, Blood
The chronic get broke down, Backwoods get rolled up
Yup, fifty Bloods when I showed up
What's beef? Chopper turnin' niggas into cold cuts
Snoop told me, ""Show love,"" but niggas ain't deserve it
I'ma talk my shit like I'm the next rapper murdered
Red sedan swervin' with the Peter Pan workin'
Hand-to-hand serve 'em right outside of Tam Burgers
Bullets ain't got no names, my fully quick to aim
I bully niggas for change, I pulled in to rip the strings
Puppet master, F&N's got 'em duckin' faster
Aftermath, you niggas know it ain't nothin' after
I can't chill 'til I see a hundred mil'
Hop off a PJ in Aruba with a blunt and chill
My old apartment still in action, water runnin' still
And if I can't kill you, these L.A. summers will

It was him then me and no one after
So I blazed my trail and wrote my own chapters
Stomped down pterodactical raptors

Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me

Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me

When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some, they may go for cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
It would bore me terrifically, too
Yet, I get a kick out of you
I get a kick every time I see you
Standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to see
You obviously do not adore me

Had the best time and now it's the worst time

Don't promise that you're gonna write, don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'Cause you were mine for the summer, now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September but I always will remember
You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love
Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind
Don't say the word that's on your lips, don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey

'Cause you were mine for the summer, now we know it's nearly over

And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar
And pathetic
And alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

Shadows are falling and I’ve been here all day
It’s too hot to sleep and time is running away
I feel like my soul has turned into steel
I’ve still got the scars that the sun didn’t let me heal
There’s not even room enough to be anywhere

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there

Well, my sense of humanity has gone down the drain
Behind every beautiful thing there’s been some kind of pain
She wrote me a letter and she wrote it so kind
She put down in writing what was in her mind
I just don’t see why I should even care
It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there

Well, I’ve been to London and I’ve been to gay Paris
I’ve followed the river and I got to the sea
I’ve been down to the bottom of a world full of lies
I ain’t lookin' for nothing in anyone’s eyes
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear

It’s not dark yet, but it’s getting there

I was born here, and I’ll die here, against my will
I know it looks like I’m moving, but I’m standing still
Every nerve in my body is so naked and numb
I can’t even remember what it was I came here to get away from
Don’t even hear a murmur of a prayer

And it's not dark yet, but it's getting there
Sometimes my burden is more than I can bear

The world is waiting for you
May all your dreaming fill the empty sky
But if it makes you happy
Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side
And if you don't let go, it's gonna pass you by
Who kicked a hole in the sky so the heavens would cry over me?
Who stole the soul from the sun in a world come undone at the seams?

Let there be love

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song

Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hanging out with the sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hanging out with the sandman
And though there's rain outside, you'll bе warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lovе
Hanging out with the sandman

Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky

Bibia be ye ye

I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, ""Always say what's on your mind""
And I am only being honest with you, I

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I

That I'd be playing solitaire

And order orange juice for one
It never entered my mind

You had what I lack myself
Now I even have to scratch my back myself
Once you warned me that if you scorned me
I'd say a lonely prayer again
And wish that you were there again

From the Beach to executive meetings, more money, two million this week, nigga
From a street killer to a multi-million dollar weed dealer

The breadwinner (The breadwinner), I'm so rich and I'm never bitter
Runnin' game like a treadmill, cold nigga, big winner
Cruisin' down the 405, choose a place, yours or mine
We can make this legal paper, no need to read between the lines
Now we talkin' stocks and bonds, NFTs and cryptos
The money profit crackin', so to the bank a Crip go
I'm all about investments, I'm all your homies' reference
My boss moves on the top news, Snoop Dogg, he do not lose
The homie built a new franchise, needed one million, so I dropped two
Showed the nigga what the guap do when I stop through and I pop through and I got you
Cruisin' down the 405 (405), yes
Take a break to catch a vibe (Catch a vibe)

Katy Perry,Smile (Deluxe),Message from katy,Pop,Freak37,/songs/14. Message From Katy.mp3,/image/cover-242.jpg,"Message from Katy Perry LyricsHello to everybody listening to Smile, it's Katy Perry.
I wanna say a very special hello to all of my incredible, beautiful, loyal, encouraging KatyCats all around the world.
Thank you so much for being on this journey with me every single time I put out a record, and for being excited and letting the music, um... work its magic on you, and for showing up at the shows, and all the little places, and for being such an incredible team and a support system that I can always rely on.
I am so incredibly grateful for each and every one of you, and the things that you make online, that make me laugh, and the care that you show, and... all of it, I am so profoundly grateful.
And that's what a lot of this record is: it's, it's a... a record that I never really set out to make, but here we are. You know, after continuing my writing process for 2 years, I would get a little message and just be a vessel for, um... different songs or ideas over the past 2 years, and we had many of them so we felt like, maybe it should be a record. Maybe the record should be called ""Smile"", and it should be about finding your smile once again.
Um... I don't know about any of you, but sometimes I can feel super low, and alone, and really in my head, and be my own worst enemy, and let that horrible negative voice that trickle, trickles in and out of my, of my head, take over. And, in this past couple of years I've really, um, tried to work on that; and I think a lot of these songs reflect walking through that process, walking through that valley, and coming out the other end alive, and giving live, and, um...
So, I just, I'm so grateful you guys are listening, I, um... I'm excited, I wanna know what your favorite songs are. I have one more song that you're about to hear, um, this song is kind of a funny, sassy song. Definitely don't @ me when you hear it, but thank you once again for listening to all the songs. I hope these songs are encouraging and can lift you out of whatever you're feeling, or give you a little umpfh, or, um... give you whatever you need for today. And if you lost your smile, it helps you find your smile again.
God bless you! I love you.3Embed",

Made a meal and threw it up on Sunday
I've got a lot of things to learn
Said I would and I'll be leaving one day
Before my heart starts to burn

So what's the matter with you?
Sing me something new
Don't you know the cold and wind and rain don't know

We passed upon the stairs
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn't there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
I thought you died alone
A long long time ago

Oh no, not me
We never lost control
You're face to face
With the man who sold the world
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home
I searched for foreign land
For years and years I roamed
I gazed a gazely stare
We walked a million hills
I must have died alone
A long, long time ago

Who knows? Not me
I never lost control
You're face to face

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, ""No
You can't marry my daughter""

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran

And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth

But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do

I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore

And I've been through mountains and seas

And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love

Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said

To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad

Tried to tell it like it is
There's a chance that I'll regret it, so

Fixing up a car, driving it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
See a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm an umbrella is saying
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying

We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up
Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
How come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes I wanna grow, yes I want to feel
Yes I wanna know, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love
When the going is rough, saying

We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
We’re gonna get it, get it together I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go

And you can say what is, or fight for it
Close your mind or take a risk
You can say it’s mine and clench your fist
Or see each sunrise as a gift

We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower

Changing their mind from the paint on a sign?
Is there anyone who really recalls ever breaking rank, at all
For something someone yelled real loud, one time?

Oh, everyone believes
And they're not going easily

Belief is a beautiful armor
But makes for the heaviest sword
Like punching underwater
You never can hit who you're trying for
Some need the exhibition
And some have to know they tried
It's the chemical weapon for the war that's ragin' on inside
Oh, everyone believes
From emptiness to everything
Oh, everyone believes
And no one's going quietly

We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war
We're never going to beat this, if belief is what we're fighting for
We're never going to win the world
We're never going to stop the war

Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay

You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay

When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good

Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care

The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf

Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do (Why I do)

And he's all that I need to fall into

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been

Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring

Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my

Here's a song
It reminds me of when we were young
Looking back at all the things we've done
You gotta keep on keeping on
Out to sea
Is the only place I honestly
Can get myself some piece of mind
You know it's getting hard to fly
If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

If I'm to fall
Would you be there to applaud
Or would you hide behind them all
'Cause if I have to go
In my heart you grow
And that's where you belong

This particular diamond was extra special
And though you might be gone, and the world may not know
Still I see you, celestial

Like a lion you ran, a goddess you rolled
Like an eagle, you circled, in perfect purple
So how come things move on? How come cars don’t slow?
When it feels like the end of my world
When I should, but I can’t let you go

But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I’m cold, cold
There’s a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There’s a feelin' within me, everglow
Like brothers in blood, sisters who ride
And we swore on that night, we’d be friends 'til we die
But the changin' of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the fallin' of snow
And now I’m gonna miss you, I know

But when I’m cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
And I know that you’re with me and the way you will show
And you’re with me wherever I go
And you give me this feelin', this everglow

Oh, what I wouldn't give for just a moment to hold
Yeah, I live for this feelin', this everglow

She got a walk like Cleo, and she could bust a move like Patra
Love it when a man gets Frank, with just a lil side of Sinatra
Take a look at that sister, you could tell she a queen
She’d get a little sidetracked but she’s focused on that dream
She knows she deserves a king, and I gotta mane that says I’m next
Everything the light touches is ours and our suns will never set
Afro-Queen, Afro-King, Afrodite, and I hope you don’t take this lightly
When I say that you just might be, so slightly -
Interesting, and you focused on all the best things
Like respect and blessings, leave a nigga without no questions (no questions)
Eye to eye, I n’ I - considered making you Isis
So I gotta dress yo' hands, with some fine metals and ices
We ain’t worried bout prices, we cannot determine how short this life is
So we gotta try things when they’re still new and exciting, and it look inviting
Afrodite, they lookin' so inviting
Afrodite, they lookin' so inviting
Afrodite, listen to me Ms. Afrodite
I can tell you got that soul, all you gotta do is let me light it
Afrodite, listen to me Ms. Afrodite
I can tell you got that soul, all you gotta do is let me light it

The Earth is her safari, watch her as she stroll
And her pupils kinda starry, you can see straight to her soul
Afrodite when she move, Afrodite when she walk
Afrodite when she write me, Afrodite when she talk
She make a nigga strong, she make a nigga weak, and she the best scene
So she make a nigga seek, tryna be the Cacique of this mountain peak
Called Olympus, she sunbathes on a nimbus
Channeling the energy like the Indus
She just got her wings fit
And when my soul got a song she sings it
Look into her eyes and we zinged quick
A nigga fell in love with a King’s kid
We could stroll around the park, conversation after dark
On and on about the next lifetime; 'till an Orange Moon sparks
And all the things we may see could never make our areas gray
Afrodite you ignite me - and this flame is here to stay

I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright

Will you wake up by my side?”

Until Monday morning feels another life

Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)40Embed",

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me, in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again, I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?

It’s been a long time since 22

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again

Da-da-da-da

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs

River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about

You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire

Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history

I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather

In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine


Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back

Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

No, I'm not color blind
I know the world is black and white
I try to keep an open mind
But, I just can't sleep on this tonight

Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?

Don't know how else to say it
Don't want to see my parents go
One generation's length away
From fighting life out on my own
Stop this train
I want to get off and go home again
I can't take the speed it's moving in
I know I can't
But honestly, won't someone stop this train?


So scared of getting older
I'm only good at being young
So I play the numbers game
To find a way to say that life has just begun

Had a talk with my old man
Said, ""Help me understand""
He said, ""Turn 68, you'll renegotiate""

""Don't stop this train
Don't, for a minute, change the place you're in
And don't think I couldn't ever understand
I tried my hand
John, honestly, we'll never stop this train""
Once in a while, when it's good
It'll feel like it should
And they're all still around
And they're still safe and sound
And you don't miss a thing
'Til you cry when you're driving away in the dark

I want to get off and go home again

I know I can't

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

Oh, listen to that now
Heh, heh, heh
Oh look out! It's-""

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt

You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll


Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky

'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?13Embed",

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)

And that's why (Red, red) he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me (Red, red), burning red

To come around
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance

So many eyes I can see
I'm static and I can't move my feet
From the moment that you stood next to me
Feeling manic, I forgot how to speak

There's a rhythm inside that I can't slow down
In this moment in time, no I won't stop now
Or give up, my hand's up, for love
And there's a rhythm inside that I can't slow down
In this moment in time, no I won't stop now
Give up, my hands up, for love

It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come show me what you're feeling
It feels like I can be the one for your love
Come show me how you're feeling
Come show me
Come show me what you're feeling
Come show me how you're feeling
(show me what you're feeling)
Time only knows how to heal
Feels like magic, I don't know if this is real
When the lights go out and my feet
Don't even wanna touch the ground
I feel the panic of my world turned upside down

There's a rhythm inside that I can't slow down
In this moment in time, no I won't stop now
Or give up, my hand's up, for love
And there's a rhythm inside that I can't slow down
In this moment in time, no I won't stop now
Give up, my hands up, for love

Come show me what you're feeling

Have you ever lost, lost the light in your life?
Have you ever left, left yourself behind?
Have you ever lied and just replied ""I'm fine""?
'Cause I can see you've lost, lost the light in your life

Wanna run like your mascara
Wine-stained lips talkin' to the mirror

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
If love has left you with, with a question mark
If trust has left you fallin' in nobody's arms

If you wanna hide like your emotions
Heart can't break, it's already broken
If the sun comes up, don't even care at all

Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Just keep on dancin' with those teary eyes
Promise one day, baby, they're gonna dry

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

(Are we out of the woods?)

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
You were looking at me

Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?

Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run

Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest

See how they run

Lady Madonna, lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head

Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending

Trying to get to Holland or France

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Finally made the plane into Paris
Honeymooning down by the Seine
Peter Brown called to say, ""You can make it okay
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain""
Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be
The way things are going
They're gonna crucify me

Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton
Talking in our beds for a week
The news people said, ""Say what you doing in bed?""
I said, ""We're only trying to get us some peace""

Christ, you know it ain't easy
You know how hard it can be

Saving up your money for a rainy day
Giving all your clothes to charity
Last night the wife said, ""Poor boy, when you're dead
You don't take nothing with you but your soul""

Made a lightning trip to Vienna
Eating chocolate cake in a bag
The newspaper said, ""She's gone to his head
They look just like two gurus in drag""

You know how hard it can be
The way things are going

Caught the early plane back to London
Fifty acorns tied in a sack

Told them your dreams, and they all started laughing
I guess you're out of your mind 'til it actually happens

I'm the small town
One in seven billion
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
They said I'm going nowhere, tried to count me out
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house
They tell me that I'm crazy, but I'll never let 'em change me
'Til they cover me in daisies, daisies, daisies
When did we all stop believing in magic?
Why did we put all our hopes in a box in the attic?

I'm the long shot
I'm the Hail Mary
Why can't it be me?

They told me I was out there, tried to knock me down (Knock me down)
Took those sticks and stones, showed 'em I could build a house

I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on

*alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

Ahh-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ahh

I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
I'll flew me to places I'd never been

Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah

Comes creeping in

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair but I thought “How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?”

They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down then we go down together

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the Internet
Out on the terrace
We breathe in the air of this small town on our own, cuttin' class for the thrill of it
Getting drunk on the past, we were livin' in

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me91Embed",

Somebody said you got a new friend
But does she love you better than I can?
And there's a big black sky over my town
I know where you're at, I bet she's around
And yeah I know it's stupid, but I just gotta see it for myself

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh
I keep dancing on my own

I just wanna dance all night
And I’m all messed up, I’m so out of line, yeah
Stilettos and broken bottles
I’m spinning around in circles
And I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh oh oh
And I'm right over here, why can't you see me? Oh oh oh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, ooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah

So far away, but still so near
The lights come on, the music dies
But you don't see me standing here
I just came to say goodbye

I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, ohh
And I'm giving it my all
But I'm not the guy you're taking home, oooh
I keep dancing on my own
And oh, nah
Said I'm in the corner, watching you kiss her, oh​ no

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

Every day, Groundhog Day
Goin' through motions felt so fake
Not myself, not my best
Felt like I failed the test
But every tear has been a lesson
Rejection can be God's protection
Long hard road to get that redemption
But no shortcuts to a blessin'

Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (Smile)
I'm so thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Now you see me shine from a mile
Finally got back that smile (Smile)

I'm 2.0, remodeled
Used to be dull, now I sparkle
Had a piece of humble pie
That ego check saved my life

Now I got a smile like Lionel Richie
Big and bright, need shades just to see me
Tryna stay alive just like I'm the Bee Gees (Oh, woah)
A Mona Lisa masterpiece (Now I'm)
Yeah, I'm thankful
Scratch that, baby, I'm grateful
Gotta say it's really been a while
But now I got back that smile (C'mon, smile, woo)

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Only you, you, you
Only you, you, you

I remember in the schoolyard
The children didn't understand
So they bullied me with silence
Just for being who I am
So I got good at keeping secrets
I used to blend in with the crowds
On the inside I was screaming
With you I didn't have to hide

Only you could see that I was hurting
Only you ever cared to understand
Always know that I'd do the same
I'd do anything for you my friend
It's true
I used to stare up at the ceiling
Wide awake all through the night
While the world was busy sleeping
I was so caught up in my mind

Only you, could see that I was hurting
Only you ever cared to understand
Always know that I'd do the same
I'd do anything for you my friend
It's true, so true

Oh, when I'm all alone
A million miles away from home
You're still with me, you'll always be
My rock and shoulder to lean on
When every hope I have is gone
I'll turn to you, you know it's true

Only you could see that I was hurting
Only you ever cared to understand
Always know that I'd do the same
I'd do anything for you my friend

And I know, 'til the bitter end

I'm from the east side of America
Where we choose pride over character
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is
I live on the west side of America
Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

And don't believe the narcissism
When everyone projects and expects you to listen to 'em
Make no mistake, I live in a prison
That I built myself, it is my religion
And they say that I am the sick boy
Easy to say when you don't take the risk, boy
Welcome to the narcissism
Yeah, we're united under our indifference
And I'm from the east side of America
Where we desensitize by hysteria
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

Where they spin lies into fairy dust
And we can pick sides, but this is us, this is us, this is

Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime

You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do

Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
